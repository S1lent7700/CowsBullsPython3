The cows and bulls game written in using Python3.8

## Usage
```
For normal program runtime, launch the cb2.py with the argument "normal":

python3 cb2.py normal
```
- This will run the program without overriding the integer

```
To override the integer, simply launch the program cb2.py with your 4-digit integer as the argument:

python3 cb2.py 3241
```
- This will set 3241 as the 4-digit integer to guess.
